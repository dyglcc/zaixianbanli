ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* Android.mk
* bsp/
* bsp/.DS_Store
* bsp/com/
* bsp/com/.DS_Store
* bsp/com/mediatek/
* bsp/com/mediatek/.DS_Store
* bsp/com/mediatek/FMRadio/
* bsp/com/mediatek/FMRadio/ExtensionUtils.java
* ext/
* ext/.DS_Store
* ext/Android.mk
* ext/src/
* ext/src/.DS_Store
* ext/src/com/
* ext/src/com/.DS_Store
* ext/src/com/mediatek/
* ext/src/com/mediatek/.DS_Store
* ext/src/com/mediatek/FMRadio/
* ext/src/com/mediatek/FMRadio/.DS_Store
* ext/src/com/mediatek/FMRadio/ext/
* ext/src/com/mediatek/FMRadio/ext/DefaultProjectStringExt.java
* ext/src/com/mediatek/FMRadio/ext/IProjectStringExt.java
* turnkey/
* turnkey/.DS_Store
* turnkey/com/
* turnkey/com/.DS_Store
* turnkey/com/mediatek/
* turnkey/com/mediatek/.DS_Store
* turnkey/com/mediatek/FMRadio/
* turnkey/com/mediatek/FMRadio/ExtensionUtils.java

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => fMRadio/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => fMRadio/src/main/res/
* src/ => fMRadio/src/main/java/
* src/.DS_Store => fMRadio/src/main/resources/.DS_Store
* src/com/.DS_Store => fMRadio/src/main/resources/com/.DS_Store
* src/com/mediatek/.DS_Store => fMRadio/src/main/resources/com/mediatek/.DS_Store

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
